# libtuya-openwrt

A library to use the [Tuya IoT Core SDK](https://github.com/tuya/tuya-iot-core-sdk) on OpenWRT devices. Doesn't provide any extra wrapper methods, so features exposed and usage is the same as with the original SDK. The only changes are so that the SDK is built as dynamically and not statically linked libraries.
